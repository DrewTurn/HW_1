what is bad with this design is first of all that there are several button looking opject cluttering the real buttons that are used. Also the buttons are not concistant with their placement with the bottom two beining one over the two then every other pair is side by side.

elevators are almost only used to travel between floors so the buttons that are almost are the buttens that select floors. The other ones that are less commonly used are the ones used to open and close the door incase people need to get inside or leave and the doors will not stay open or closed. The last least most common buttons used are to call the firemen or stop the elevator incase of getting stuck or a fire. 
 
in the normlal sequance on events someone would push the call button on the outside then the elevator comes and the user select the floor where the elevator then travles to that floor and drops the user off. 

during this to provide feedback the outside of the elevator there is a screen to show what floor it is at and what way it was travaling. on the inside if you press abutton then it lights up and there is normaly a screen that shows what floor is at.

however with the design that is in the elevator as it is it is possable to accedently sealect the wrong floor it is also possable to not understand what button to press in an emergancy or press one of the emergency buttons insted of selecting at floor. 

to fix this I would put all the floor select buttons over each other and on the left side of the control panel. this provides a design that follows the the design of the floors so the user instenctivly knows how to select the floor. then on the right of those buttons i would put the emergency call and stop buttons under a plastic panel to prevent accadentale pushing.
